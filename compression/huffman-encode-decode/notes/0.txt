In theory, Huffman coding is an optimal coding method whenever the true frequencies are known, and the frequency of a letter is independent of the context of that letter in the message. 
In practice, the frequencies of letters in an English text document do change depending on context. 
For example, while E is the most commonly used letter of the alphabet in English documents, T is more common as the first letter of a word. 
This is why most commercial compression utilities do not use Huffman coding as their primary coding method, but instead use techniques that take advantage of the context for the letters.

Another factor that affects the compression efficiency of Huffman coding is the relative frequencies of the letters. 
Some frequency patterns will save no space as compared to fixed-length codes; others can result in great compression. 
In general, Huffman coding does better when there is large variation in the frequencies of letters.
